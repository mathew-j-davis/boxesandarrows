# StyleResolver Implementation and Testing

## Overview

Today we implemented the StyleResolver class, a key component in our redesigned style system. This implementation follows our design discussions and refinements documented in previous journal entries. The StyleResolver provides robust handling of style name normalization, resolution, and caching.

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Style Name Normalization

We implemented comprehensive style name normalization with:

- Robust handling of various input formats (string, array)
- Support for multiple delimiters (comma, pipe, ampersand)
- Preservation of spaces within style names
- Validation of style name format using regex
- Addition of 'base' style as first style if not present

Key implementation details:
```javascript
// Style name validation regex:
// - Must start with a letter (no leading numbers)
// - Can contain letters, numbers, and spaces
const styleNamePattern = /^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9 ]*$/;
```

### 2. Efficient Caching

The StyleResolver includes a caching system to avoid redundant style resolution:

- Each unique style combination is cached
- Cache keys use JSON.stringify for proper handling of arrays
- Intermediate style combinations are cached for better performance
- Cache invalidation is available when styles change

### 3. Clean API

The final StyleResolver class provides a clean, simple API:

- `resolveStyles(styleNames)`: Main method to get merged properties for styles
- `normalizeStyleNames(styleNames)`: Utility to ensure base is included
- `clearCache()`: Clear cached style resolutions
- `invalidateStyle(styleName)`: Invalidate cache for a specific style

## Refactoring Insights

During implementation, we made several refinements:

1. **Inner Function Refactoring**:
   - Extracted string processing logic into a helper function for better readability
   - Used `this` binding with `.call()` to ensure proper context

2. **Code Consolidation**:
   - Unified handling of final style array construction
   - Improved error handling and edge cases

3. **Style Name Validation**:
   - Added explicit validation to ensure style names follow conventions
   - Silently filters out invalid style names

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive test suite was created covering:

1. **String Splitting**:
   - Tests for each delimiter type
   - Mixed delimiter handling
   - Whitespace trimming
   - Empty input handling

2. **Style Name Normalization**:
   - Single style names
   - Array inputs
   - Delimited array elements
   - Invalid style name filtering
   - Base style positioning

3. **Style Resolution**:
   - Property merging order
   - Caching behavior
   - Cache invalidation

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**:
   - Integrate StyleResolver with StyleHandler
   - Update consumers to use the new style resolution approach

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Evaluate caching effectiveness
   - Profile style resolution in large diagrams

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update user documentation for style naming conventions
   - Document style validation constraints

## Key Decisions

1. Used 'base' as the default style name (constant)
2. Process delimiters in both string and array inputs
3. Added validation to enforce style naming conventions
4. Preserved spaces within style names
5. Cache intermediate style combinations for performance

The StyleResolver implementation provides a solid foundation for our enhanced style system, with clear separation of concerns and robust handling of edge cases.
