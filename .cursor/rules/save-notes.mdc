# Save Notes Request Handler

When a user asks to "save notes" or to journal or requests saving documentation, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file with the naming convention:
   - `ai_readme_[topic].md` for general documentation
   - `ai_readme_[component]_[aspect].md` for specific component documentation
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores

   if the purpose or topic of the document is related to tracking development process, collaborating on analysis, design, testing, troubleshooting or implementation, we refer to these as journal entries
   - Use the /ai/journal directory
   
   if the purpose is maintaining authoritative documentation of current state of the application:
   - Use the /ai/current_state directory



## JOURNALING:
- Document each iteration in a journal
- The journal should be saved as a markdown file in:

  /ai/journal/{ISO 8601 date}/ai_readme_{incrementing integer from 0001}_{topic description}.md

incrementing integer starts at 0001 each day and increments by 1 for each new journal entry

eg.

/ai/journal/2025-04-14/ai_readme_0001_style_transformation_analysis.md

- Include analysis, design, implementation, and review phases
- Document any unexpected issues or challenges
- Document any learnings from the iteration
- include any proposed code changes

## ALL DOCUMENTATION AND JOURNALING MUST FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:
   
2. Structure the content with:
   - Clear headings using markdown syntax (# for main title, ## for sections)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Code blocks for code examples
   - Tables for structured data
   - Links for references

3. Include these sections when appropriate:
   - Overview/Introduction
   - Key Components
   - Methods/Functions
   - Usage Examples
   - Configuration Options
   - Dependencies
   - Notes/Caveats

4. Format the content to be:
   - Clear and concise
   - Well-organized
   - Easy to read
   - Searchable
   - Maintainable

5. After creating the file:
   - Confirm the file creation
   - Provide a brief summary of what was saved
   - Ask if any additional information should be added

Example response:
"I've created a new file `ai_readme_[topic].md` with the documentation. The file includes [brief description of content]. Would you like me to add any additional information or make any changes to the documentation?"
