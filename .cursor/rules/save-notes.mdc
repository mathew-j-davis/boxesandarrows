# Save Notes Request Handler

When a user asks to "save notes" or requests saving documentation, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file with the naming convention:
   - `ai_readme_[topic].md` for general documentation
   - `ai_readme_[component]_[aspect].md` for specific component documentation
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores

2. Structure the content with:
   - Clear headings using markdown syntax (# for main title, ## for sections)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Code blocks for code examples
   - Tables for structured data
   - Links for references

3. Include these sections when appropriate:
   - Overview/Introduction
   - Key Components
   - Methods/Functions
   - Usage Examples
   - Configuration Options
   - Dependencies
   - Notes/Caveats

4. Format the content to be:
   - Clear and concise
   - Well-organized
   - Easy to read
   - Searchable
   - Maintainable

5. After creating the file:
   - Confirm the file creation
   - Provide a brief summary of what was saved
   - Ask if any additional information should be added

Example response:
"I've created a new file `ai_readme_[topic].md` with the documentation. The file includes [brief description of content]. Would you like me to add any additional information or make any changes to the documentation?"
