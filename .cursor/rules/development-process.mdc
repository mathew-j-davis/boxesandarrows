DEVELOPMENT PROCESS GUIDELINES
-----------------------------

This prompt applies only to development-related discussions and code changes. It can be ignored if explicitly directed otherwise.

OUR APPROACH:
- Make incremental, focused changes with each step
- Ensure tests pass after each change
- Avoid breaking existing functionality
- Discuss changes before implementation
- Document design decisions and implementation details

FOR EACH ITERATION:
1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Review current codebase structure
   - Identify specific components affected by the change
   - Outline potential approaches with pros/cons

2. DESIGN PHASE:
   - Propose specific changes with minimal scope
   - Discuss potential impacts on existing functionality
   - Identify test cases that might be affected

3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   - Implement changes in small, testable increments
   - Run tests after each change
   - Document any unexpected issues or challenges

4. REVIEW PHASE:
   - Evaluate the success of the changes
   - Identify any regressions or new issues
   - Plan the next iteration based on learnings

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
- Before each change: "I'm planning to make the following change to [component]. Here's my reasoning and approach."
- After each change: "I've implemented [change]. Here are the results and any issues encountered."
- For decisions: "I'm considering [options]. Here are the tradeoffs as I see them."
