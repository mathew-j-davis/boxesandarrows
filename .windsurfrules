# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS GUIDELINES
-----------------------------

This prompt applies only to development-related discussions and code changes. It can be ignored if explicitly directed otherwise.

## OUR APPROACH:
- Make incremental, focused changes with each step
- Ensure tests pass after each change
- Avoid breaking existing functionality
- Collaborate through each stage of the process
- Document design decisions and implementation details

## FOR EACH ITERATION:
### 1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Review current codebase structure
   - Identify specific components affected by the change
   - Outline potential approaches with pros/cons
   - **Get user approval before proceeding to implementation**

### 2. DESIGN PHASE:
   - Propose specific changes with minimal scope
   - Discuss potential impacts on existing functionality
   - Identify test cases that might be affected

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   - Implement changes in small, testable increments
   - Run tests after each change
   - Document any unexpected issues or challenges
   - **Present each change for user review before proceeding**

### 4. REVIEW PHASE:

   - Evaluate the success of the changes
   - Identify any regressions or new issues
   - Plan the next iteration based on learnings
   - **Get user confirmation before considering the iteration complete**

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
- Before analysis: "Let's analyze the current structure and discuss potential approaches."
- After analysis: "Based on our analysis, here are the key findings. Shall we proceed to design?"
- Before design: "I'm proposing the following design approach. What do you think?"
- After design: "With your approval, I'll implement these changes."
- During implementation: "I've made this change. Would you like to review it before I continue?"
- After implementation: "I've completed the implementation. Let's review the results."
- For decisions: "I'm considering these options. What are your thoughts?"

## COLLABORATION CHECKPOINTS:
- After completing the analysis phase
- Before starting the design phase
- Before implementing each significant change
- After completing each implementation increment
- Before finalizing the iteration

## JOURNALING:
- Document each iteration in a journal
- The journal should be saved as a markdown file in:

  /ai/{ISO 8601 date}/ai_readme_{incrementing integer from 0000}_{topic description}.md

incrementing integer starts at 0000 each day and increments by 1 for each new journal entry

eg.

/ai/2025-04-14/ai_readme_0001_style_transformation_analysis.md

- Include analysis, design, implementation, and review phases
- Document any unexpected issues or challenges
- Document any learnings from the iteration
- include any proposed code changes
