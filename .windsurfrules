# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS GUIDELINES
-----------------------------

This prompt applies only to development-related discussions and code changes. It can be ignored if explicitly directed otherwise.

## OUR APPROACH:
- Make incremental, focused changes with each step
- Ensure tests pass after each change
- Avoid breaking existing functionality
- Collaborate through each stage of the process
- Document design decisions and implementation details

## FOR EACH ITERATION:
### 1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Review current codebase structure
   - Identify specific components affected by the change
   - Outline potential approaches with pros/cons
   - **Get user approval before proceeding to implementation**

### 2. DESIGN PHASE:
   - Propose specific changes with minimal scope
   - Discuss potential impacts on existing functionality
   - Identify test cases that might be affected

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   - Implement changes in small, testable increments
   - Run tests after each change
   - Document any unexpected issues or challenges
   - **Present each change for user review before proceeding**

### 4. REVIEW PHASE:

   - Evaluate the success of the changes
   - Identify any regressions or new issues
   - Plan the next iteration based on learnings
   - **Get user confirmation before considering the iteration complete**

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
- Before analysis: "Let's analyze the current structure and discuss potential approaches."
- After analysis: "Based on our analysis, here are the key findings. Shall we proceed to design?"
- Before design: "I'm proposing the following design approach. What do you think?"
- After design: "With your approval, I'll implement these changes."
- During implementation: "I've made this change. Would you like to review it before I continue?"
- After implementation: "I've completed the implementation. Let's review the results."
- For decisions: "I'm considering these options. What are your thoughts?"

## COLLABORATION CHECKPOINTS:
- After completing the analysis phase
- Before starting the design phase
- Before implementing each significant change
- After completing each implementation increment
- Before finalizing the iteration

## JOURNALING:
- Document each iteration in a journal
- The journal should be saved as a markdown file in:

  /ai/journal/{ISO 8601 date}/ai_readme_{incrementing integer from 0000}_{topic description}.md

incrementing integer starts at 0000 each day and increments by 1 for each new journal entry

eg.

/ai/journal/2025-04-14/ai_readme_0001_style_transformation_analysis.md

- Include analysis, design, implementation, and review phases
- Document any unexpected issues or challenges
- Document any learnings from the iteration
- include any proposed code changes

we'll use /ai/journal

to journal our development process

we'll use /ai/current_state
exclusively for documentation about the current state of the application


When a user asks to "save notes" or to journal or requests saving documentation, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file with the naming convention:
   - `ai_readme_[topic].md` for general documentation
   - `ai_readme_[component]_[aspect].md` for specific component documentation
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores

   if the purpose or topic of the document is related to tracking development process, collaborating on analysis, design, testing, troubleshooting or implementation, we refer to these as journal entries
   - Use the /ai/journal directory
   
   if the purpose is maintaining authoritative documentation of current state of the application:
   - Use the /ai/current_state directory



## JOURNALING:
- Document each iteration in a journal
- The journal should be saved as a markdown file in:

  /ai/journal/{ISO 8601 date}/ai_readme_{incrementing integer from 0000}_{topic description}.md

incrementing integer starts at 0000 each day and increments by 1 for each new journal entry

eg.

/ai/journal/2025-04-14/ai_readme_0001_style_transformation_analysis.md

- Include analysis, design, implementation, and review phases
- Document any unexpected issues or challenges
- Document any learnings from the iteration
- include any proposed code changes

## ALL DOCUMENTATION AND JOURNALING MUST FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:
   
2. Structure the content with:
   - Clear headings using markdown syntax (# for main title, ## for sections)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Code blocks for code examples
   - Tables for structured data
   - Links for references

3. Include these sections when appropriate:
   - Overview/Introduction
   - Key Components
   - Methods/Functions
   - Usage Examples
   - Configuration Options
   - Dependencies
   - Notes/Caveats

4. Format the content to be:
   - Clear and concise
   - Well-organized
   - Easy to read
   - Searchable
   - Maintainable

5. After creating the file:
   - Confirm the file creation
   - Provide a brief summary of what was saved
   - Ask if any additional information should be added

Example response:
"I've created a new file `ai_readme_[topic].md` with the documentation. The file includes [brief description of content]. Would you like me to add any additional information or make any changes to the documentation?"
